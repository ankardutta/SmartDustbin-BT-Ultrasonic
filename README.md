🗑️ Smart Dustbin – Bluetooth & Ultrasonic Sensor Enabled  


 📌 Overview  
This project was developed as part of an initiative to blend technology with sustainability. As the project coordinator, I guided and collaborated with students, ensuring smooth execution and learning at every step.  

🌟 Features  
✅ Ultrasonic Sensor – Detects objects and opens the lid automatically  
✅ Bluetooth Connectivity – Enables remote control via a mobile app  
✅ Energy Efficient – Optimized for low power consumption  
✅ Easy to Use – Simple setup and operation  

🛠️ Components Used  
- Arduino UNO R3 Development Board  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Servo Motor (SG-90)  
- Bluetooth Module (HC-05)  
- 9-volt battery
- Jumper Wire ( Male to male/Male to Female, Female to female)

🔧 How It Works  
1. The ultrasonic sensor detects nearby movement.  
2. If an object (e.g., hand) is detected, the servo motor opens the lid.  
3. The Bluetooth module allows manual control through a mobile app.  
4. The bin automatically closes after a set time.

📱 Mobile App (Built with MIT App Inventor)
The mobile app for controlling the Smart Dustbin was built using MIT App Inventor, a beginner-friendly, drag-and-drop app development platform.
